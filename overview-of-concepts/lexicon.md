Before we dive into the concepts, let's clarify the terminology we'll be using

|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Transform Function,  or simply Function | A python function used to represent a Hamilton transform -- it can compile to one (in the standard case) or many (with the use of decorators) transforms. See [writing functions](writing-transform-functions.md) for more details.                                  |
| Transform                               | A step in the dataflow DAG representing a computation -- usually 1:1 with functions but decorators break that pattern -- in which case multiple transforms trace back to a single function.                                                                          |
| Node                                    | Synonymous with Transform. A node in the DAG, is equivalent to a transform step in the DAG. We just sometimes aren't consistent with our terminology.                                                                                                                |
| Dataflow                                | The organization of functions and dependencies. This is a DAG -- it's directed (one function is running before the other), acyclic, (there are no cycles, i.e., no function runs before itself), and a graph (it is easily naturally represented by nodes and edges) |
| Hamilton Driver                         | A specific class written to enable execution of the DAG with certain parameters. This will be your main interface with your Hamilton code. See [drivers](the-hamilton-driver.md) for more detail.                                                                    |
| Driver script/code                      | Code that you write to tell Hamilton what the DAG is, what outputs you want, and where the inputs come from.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Config                                  | Data that dictates the way the DAG is constructed. See [parametrizing the dag](the-hamilton-driver.md#parameterizing-the-dag) for more details.                                                                                                                      |
| Decorators                              | A python function that modifies another python function in some way. Used in Hamilton to compile functions to sets of transforms. See [decorators](decorators.md) for more detail.                                                                                   |
