# API Extensions

Currently the API extensions are all experimental. Note this doesn't mean they're not well-tested or thought out -- rather that we're actively looking for feedback. More docs upcoming, but for now fish around the [experimental package](https://github.com/stitchfix/hamilton/tree/main/hamilton/experimental), and give the extensions a try!
